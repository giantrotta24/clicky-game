# React Clicky Game!

## Application Concept:
Clicky Game is a Rick & Morty themed memory game built with React. The concept of the game is simple. Start by clicking any character card. The application will increment your score every time you click a different image, click the same image and you'll get an alert and the game score will be reset. The game will also keep track of your guess streaks.
